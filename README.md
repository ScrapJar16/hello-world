# hello-world
"This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow." Kalee, are you the one that has to grade this? Or Jared or Amanda? Whoever, hi!

This is Madilyn. I am a writer, project manager, and policy analyst. I like to knit and I will talk about public pensions or pedestrian infrastructure more than most people want to hear about them. I once had a job where I needed to climb up a tree at 4 am to count ducks. Also I was SOAR's grant writer and project manager on the Recompete application, so thought I might as well take the opportunity to learn some of the stuff I'd been hearing about.

I should probably be interested in the data analysis pathway, but I think I would rather do web development because it seems like it would sync better with my other skills. Interested in getting a better understanding of the differences though.
